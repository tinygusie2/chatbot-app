The provided Flutter code exhibits several shortcomings that make it unsuitable as an example in formal contexts:

Lack of Separation of Concerns: The code lacks clear separation between different aspects of the application, such as UI and business logic. This can lead to maintenance issues and hinder scalability.
Limited Error Handling: Error handling is insufficiently addressed. Failure to handle errors effectively can result in unexpected behavior and user dissatisfaction.
Limited Testing: The absence of unit tests or integration tests leaves the code vulnerable to bugs and makes it difficult to ensure its correctness and reliability.
